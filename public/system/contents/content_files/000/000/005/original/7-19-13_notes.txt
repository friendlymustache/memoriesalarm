go to gym now until 2:00

come home around 2:15

shower, eat --> 2:45

Use USB power for arduino, external power through arduino jack for the motor shield


need to power two motors for wheels, two motors for arm



Vin - input voltage from an external power source, can be battery leads
- alternately, if a power jack is pugged in to the arduino, can be accessed through this pin

5V - outputs regulated 5V potential from board regulator. supplying voltage through this pin bypasses the regulator and may damage board


analog output pin to servo to ground to set servo position

analog output pin to jumper cable to motor to ground for each robot drive motor

arduino only has 32k of memory


1) without motor shield it's hard to turn backwards
2) arduino has a 32k memory limit so it's hard to store pictures
3) either we need an SD card on board

red  - +5v
black - gnd
white - RX pin (data into module)
green - TX pin (data from module)


final setup:

white --> resistor --> gnd
white --> second resistor --> digital pin (probably PWM)
green --> digital pin (probably PWM)
black --> gnd
red --> 5v


1) Navigate to project directory
2) Modify readme.txt in some way - maybe add a smiley face like kevin did
3) Save readme.txt
4) Go back to the GUI, click local repositories, and find Michael0x2a/Niftybot
5) Click the small blue arrow on the right side of the repository (to the right of the pin) to open the repo
6) There should be a space on the right telling you that you have uncommitted changes - the green lines are ones you've added since the last commit and the red lines are ones you've removed
7) Type in a commit message and press commit. This saves a record of the changes you've made to your local master branch
8) Press sync to push your commit to the repository stored on github, thereby allowing everyone else to access it.
